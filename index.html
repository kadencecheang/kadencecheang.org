        <h2>Kadence Cheang is a creative who is pursuing opportunities in the business
          and technology industry. She is currently based in Dallas, Texas.</h2>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my website! I'm a rising junior at Texas A&M University
          in College Station studying business manangement information system minoring in
          cybersecurity and architectural fabrication and product design.</p>
        <p>I'm super passionate about social media marketing and developing digital content
          to help brands gain exposure to their targeted niche. Working with IPSY as their
          brand ambassador helped me gain the necessary skills in marketing to a targetted audience
          about a company's services and products. I was able to work hands on in creating
          digital content for their marketing strategy mainly on social media platforms such as
          Instagram and TikTok.</p>
